4. As a user, after selecting ML recommendations, I want to get a recommendation of songs based on what I’ve 
most recently listened to.

Happy path: I am given song suggestions that are relevant to my most heavily played songs and my most recently 
played songs. I am not shown multiple of the same song or a completely unordinary suggestion. Each song I select 
is relevant to my specific music preference.

Unhappy path: The songs that are generated for me are bland and not unique to me. It appears my music history 
was completely ignored and the songs are not relevant to me at all. Each song I select is bad and isn’t tailored 
to my specific music preference.
