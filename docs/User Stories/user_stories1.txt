1. As a user, I want to see and select my recommendation types (AI or Machine learning) right after log in.

Happy path: After I log in, I can see two big choice boxes. The left one is AI recommendation, the right 
one is Machine learning recommendation. The labels clearly appear on each box. AI recommendation provides 
recommendation based on my mode, whereas Machine learning is based on my music history. After I click on 
one of them, the script will direct me to the correct interface based on my selection.

Unhappy path: After I log in, I can't see selection panels, or the labels are missing so I failed to understand
which is which, or the labels are too wordy. After I click on them, they direct me to the wrong page, or don't 
direct me anywhere, or return a bug.
