As a user, after selecting AI recommendations, I want to be able to enter my current mood and receive a list 
of recommended songs that match my mood, so that I can discover new music that fits my current emotional state.

Happy path: As a user, I receive 5 personalized music recommendations based on my selected mood. I am able to 
play it by clicking on the link which directs me to the song on spotify.

Unhappy path: As a user, I select my current mood but the app does not provide any recommendations, provides the 
recommendation for the wrong mode, or that I receive music recommendations that do not match my selected mood or 
are not to my liking.
