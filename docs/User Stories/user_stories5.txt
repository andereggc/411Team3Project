5. As a user, I want to find a song I like, then click the link and go to that song on Spotify.

Happy path: After being recommended a song, I press the link Listen and it automatically opens 
a new tab in my browser and loads the official Spotify website, where I am already signed in on, 
and it takes me directly to the song I had just clicked Listen. 

Unhappy path: The link I click is broken and doesnâ€™t direct me to the official Spotify website for 
my browser. Additionally, if it does bring me to the official Spotify website, it does not sign me 
in to the same account as I had on the website or it does not bring me to the same song I clicked on 
earlier.
